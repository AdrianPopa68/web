# web
A simple 'hello world' test to see how GitHub Pages works
1. I created this repository in GitHub web interface with a README.md. Then I added this line in the README.
2. I will create a local folder for this project on my laptop. Done. It's named "web".
3. I created a new branch named gh-pages
4. I made the gh-pages branch default and then deleted the master branch
5. I dragged & dropped index.html from a local folder into the GitHub web interface. Previous to the commit, the webpage https://adrianpopa68.github.io/web/ displayed the README file content. After I commited the index.html, the webpage now displays the index.html content.
6. Now I will try to connect the local folder "web" to this repository, using Git Bash.
7. Wow, this was a long one, I run into some challenges, but at the end I managed to push "main.css" to the GitHub web repo. Yaay!
