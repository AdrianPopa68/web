A simple 'hello world' test to see how GitHub Pages works
1. I created this repository in GitHub web interface with a README.md. Then I added this line in the README.
2. I will create a local folder for this project on my laptop. Done
3. I created a new branch named gh-pages
4. I made the gh-pages branch default and then deleted the master branch
